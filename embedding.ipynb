In particular, the model is extended to ahierarchical model with an arbitrary number dof levels modeling multiple memory\\nand cache levels. Moreover, at each level the memory size is incorporated as an addi-\\ntional parameter. The entire model is based on a tree of depth dwith memory/caches\\nat the internal nodes and processors at the leaves.\\n4.5.3 LogP Model\\nIn [40], several concerns about the BSP model are formulated. First, the length\\nof the supersteps must be sufﬁciently large to accommodate arbitrary h-relations.\\nThis has the effect that the granularity cannot be decreased below a certain value.Second, messages sent within a superstep can only be used in the next superstep,\\neven if the interconnection network is fast enough to deliver messages within the\\nsame superstep. Third, the BSP model expects hardware support for synchronization\\nat the end of each superstep. Such support may not be available for some parallel\\nmachines. Because of these concerns, the BSP model has been extended to the LogP\\nmodel to provide a more realistic modeling of real parallel machines.\\nSimilar to the BSP model, the LogP model is based on the assumption that a paral-\\nlel computer consists of a set of processors with local memory that can communicateby exchanging point-to-point messages over an interconnection network. Thus, the\\nLogP model is also intended for the modeling of parallel computers with a distributed\\nmemory. The communication behavior of a parallel computer is described by fourparameters:\\n•L(latency) is an upper bound on the latency of the network capturing the delay\\nobserved when transmitting a small message over the network;\\n•o(overhead) is the management overhead that a processor needs for sending or\\nreceiving a message; during this time, a processor cannot perform any other oper-ation;\\n•g(gap) is the minimum time interval between consecutive send or receive opera-\\ntions of a processor;\\n•P(processors) is the number of processors of the parallel machine.\\nFigure 4.9illustrates the meaning of these parameters [39]. All parameters except\\nPare measured in time units or as multiples of the machine cycle time. Furthermore\\nit is assumed that the network has a ﬁnite capacity which means that between any\\npair of processors at most [L/g]messages are allowed to be in transmission at any\\ntime. If a processor tries to send a message that would exceed this limit, it is blocked\\nuntil the message can be transmitted without exceeding the limit. The LogP model\\nassumes that the processors exchange small messages that do not exceed a predeﬁned\\nsize. Larger messages must be split into several smaller messages. The processors\\nwork asynchronously with each other. The latency of any single message cannot be'"

       "'4.5 Parallel Computational Models 207\\n4.5.2 BSP Model\\nNone of the PRAM models proposed has really been able to capture the behavior\\nof real parallel machines for a large class of application areas in a satisfactory way.One of the reasons is that there is a large variety of different architectures for parallel\\nmachines and the architectures are steadily evolving. To avoid that the computa-\\ntional model design constantly drags behind the development of parallel computerarchitecture, the BSP model ( bulk synchronously parallel ) has been proposed as a\\nbridging model between hardware architecture and software development [193]. The\\nidea is to provide a standard on which both hardware architects and software devel-opers can agree. Thus, software development can be decoupled from the details of a\\nspeciﬁc architecture, and software does not have to be adapted when porting it to a\\nnew parallel machine.\\nThe BSP model is an abstraction of a parallel machine with a physically distrib-\\nuted memory organization. Communication between the processors is not performedas separate point-to-point transfers, but is bundled in a step-oriented way. In the BSP\\nmodel, a parallel computer consists of a number of components (processors), each\\nof which can perform processing or memory functions. The components are con-nected by a router (interconnection network) which can send point-to-point messages\\nbetween pairs of components. There is also a synchronization unit , which supports\\nthe synchronization of all or a subset of the components. A computation in the BSPmodel consists of a sequence of supersteps , see Fig. 4.8for an illustration. In each\\nsuperstep, each component performs local computations and can participate in point-\\nto-point message transmissions. A local computation can be performed in one timeunit. The effect of message transmissions becomes visible in the next time step,\\ni.e., a receiver of a message can use the received data not before the next superstep.\\nAt the end of each superstep, a barrier synchronization is performed. There is a\\nperiodicity parameter L which determines the length of the supersteps in time units.\\nThus, Ldetermines the granularity of the computations. The BSP model allows that\\nthe value of Lcan be controlled by the program to be executed, even at runtime.\\nThere may be a lower bound for Lgiven by the hardware. The parallel program to be\\nexecuted should set an upper bound for Lsuch that in each superstep, computations\\nwith approximately Lsteps can be assigned to each processor.\\nIn each superstep, the router can implement arbitrary h-relations capturing com-\\nmunication patterns, where each processor sends or receives at most hmessages.\\nA computation in the BSP model can be characterized by four parameters [99]:\\n•p: the number of (virtual) processors used within the supersteps to perform com-\\nputations;\\n•s: the execution speed of the processors expressed as the number of computation\\nsteps per seconds that each processor can perform, where each computation stepperforms an (arithmetic or logical) operation on a local data element;\\n•l: the number of steps that are required for the execution of a barrier synchronization;\\n•g: the number of steps that are required on the average for the transfer of a memory\\nword in the context of an h-relation.'"

But different hardware\\nmanufacturers favor different models, and there is no standardization as yet.\\n2.8 Example: IBM Blue Gene supercomputer\\nThe IBM Blue Gene supercomputers are popular examples for massively parallel\\nsystems. In this section, we give a short overview of the architecture of these systems.\\nAn important design goal for the Blue Gene systems was to provide a good power\\nefﬁciency, i.e., to obtain a high performance for each unit of power, measured as thenumber of Floating-Point Operations per second (FLOPS) that can be computed per\\nWatt. The Blue Gene (BG) supercomputers were introduced in 2004 as Blue Gene/L\\n(BG/L) systems and were originally intended for life science computations, suchas molecular dynamics or protein folding, but nowadays they are used for a large\\nrange of applications from science and technology. In 2007, the BG/P systems were\\nintroduced as successor of the BG/L systems, see [191] for a detailed description. In2012, the BG/Q systems have been introduced.\\nThe BG systems have a low power consumption especially because the processors\\nused have a small clock frequency, leading to low leakage currents and a reducedheat dissipation, see Sect. 2.4.3 for a short discussion of the interaction between clock\\nfrequency and power consumption. The BG systems use processors that have been\\nespecially designed for these systems. The BG/L processors had a clock frequencyof 700 MHz, the BG/P processors used a clock frequency of 850 MHz; the clock\\nfrequency of the current BG/Q processors is 1.6 GHz. The trend toward multicore\\nprocessors can also be observed for the BG processors: the BG/L and BG/P processors\\nwere dual-core and quad-core processors, the BG/Q processors contain 16 cores. In\\nthe following, we give an overview of the BG/Q systems; a more detailed descriptioncan be found in [90, 29]. A comparison of important characteristics of the BG/L,\\nBG/P, and BG/Q systems is given in Table 2.4, see also [191, 190].\\nSimilar to the BG/L and BG/P processors, the BG/Q processors are based on a\\nsystem-on-a-chip design. The processor chip contains not only the processor cores,\\nbut also control hardware for the memory subsystem and the networking subsystem.'"
